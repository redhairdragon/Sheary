## About Me

### Education

As an immigrant, I spent my first 2 years in the U.S. at **Mark Keppel High School**.  
Then I went to **Pasadena City College** and had wonderful three years there.  
With GPA 3.95/4, I transfered to **UCLA** for **my bachelor degree(GPA 3.54/4.0)** and **master degree(GPA 4.0/4.0)** .  

### Work Experience

*SDE Summer 2020, Amazon, Seattle. (I am super excited about it ü§£üòù)

### Researches

By getting involved with these super interesting projects in labs. I learnt a lot from others, and also experienced with conducting meetings and giving speeches.

#### Graph Neural Network Frameworks @ [UCLA SOLAR Lab](http://systems.cs.ucla.edu/). 

Graph Neural Networks(GNN) are the emerging machine learning models which are able to make predictions on data with mathematical graph. 

**Motivation**: There is not a distributed scalable ML framework for GNNs now.   Tensorflow/Pytorch could not handle large graph as input data inefficiently. And they don't address graph-related issue such as graph partition, aggregation/scatter programming models in distributed settings.  

Traditional Graph processing frameworks like GraphX, Pregel lack support for tensor operations e.g. ReLu, Matrix Multiplications.

**Our goal**: Build a distributed and scalable system for various GNN models. We are also exploring the potential of *serverless services e.g. AWS Lambda* as our computation backend instead of the traditional GPU approach to see if we can achieve comparable perfomance and meanwhile keep the cost relatively low.  

For this project, I am working with  the PhD student [John Thorpe](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~jothor/). My Advisor is  [Harry Xu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/).  

#### Voice Controll in Web Applications @ [UCLA HCI Lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/#aboutus)

This project explores the possibility of integrating voice modality into the existing web applications.  The first thought was to build a chrome extension. And later we decided to create a Javascript IDE which helps web developers to add voice modality into their application more easily.  

Here is a demo I made in the early stage-- [A voice controlled text editor](https://redhairdragon.github.io/Voice-Controlled-Editor/). The project also involves NLP and user studies. The project was first led by me (Sep, 2018 - Apr, 2019) and still in progress.
